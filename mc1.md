# Mini Challenge 1

### Steps
1. Create a home page
2. Create an about page
3. Your about me page (can also be about us) must contain at least one image

### Notes
You must implement all urlpatterns, models, views and templates necessary so that
when a user goes to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` they see your home page with your
navbar and when they visit `/about` they see your about me page.
